**Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging** is a process in natural language processing that assigns parts of speech to each word in a sentence, such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc. It's foundational for syntactic analysis since it provides grammatical context, allowing downstream tasks to understand sentence structure better.

Use cases include:
- Grammatical parsing for machine translation or text-to-speech systems.
- Text analytics, including sentiment analysis and summarization.
- Preprocessing for dependency parsing and syntactic analysis.

For most cases, preprocessing POS has the following recommendations:

- **Tokenization:** Break the text into smaller units (tokens), typically words or sub-words, using libraries like NLTK or SpaCy. POS tagging works at a token level.
- **Normalization:** Lowercase text, remove punctuations, and perform stemming or lemmatization as needed.
- **Handling Stop Words:** For POS tagging, stop words may remain since they provide grammatical context.
- **Sentence Segmentation:** Text should be segmented into sentences since POS models generally work sentence by sentence.

Key metrics usually include Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score
