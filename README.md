# NLP Fundamentals
The main purpose of this repo is to cement and improve my understanding of NLP fundamental concepts. I am breaking down the repo into three stages:

1) **Intermediate Topics:** implement classical NLP techniques and build small projects. Topics to cover include text representation, POS tagging and named entity recognition, language models (n-gram, markov), topics modelling, basic sentiment analysis, etc.

2) **Advanced NLP with Deep Learning:** understand NNs and transformers to work on modern NLP tasks. Topics to cover include attention mechanisms and seq2seq models, transformers, transfer-learning/fine-tuning, text generation and machine translation

3) **Applied NLP and real-world projects:** topics include MLOps and Deployment, information retrieval and search engines, and chatbots and recommendation Engines.
